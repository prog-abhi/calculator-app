Step wise breakdown of the app

1. Create a directory for the project and initialize a virtual env.
    - Name the directory 'calculator'.
    - Use pipenv to handle pip and venv
2. Create a server to receive req for a temp root endpoint, using Flask.
    - Listen at port 5000
    - root endpoint path = "/"
3. Create basic html templates.
    - all html templates in a folder named 'templates'.
    - all css and js files in folders of same respective names.
4. Create route handler to serve these templates.
    - endpoint will be "/app"
5. Implement form elements to receive data for the expression to be calculated.
6. Create a route to handle calculation query requests and sends json response back.
7. Use jinja to insert parsed response in the template.
